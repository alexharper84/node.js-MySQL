## CLI Operation

Bamazon will prompt users with two questions:

- "What would you like to buy?"
- "How many?"
---
Once the customer has placed the order, the application will check if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

- if the store is out of stock, the app will reply with:
> "Not enough in stock!"
- if the transaction was successful:
> "Thanks for your purchase!"
---
The app will then print a receipt of the purchase and give the customer the option to make another purchase.

### Happy Buying!
